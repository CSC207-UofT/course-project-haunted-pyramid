Scenario walk through:
MainController is instantiated when program is run.
Controller instantiates IO controller, and login controller with default logged in false
The MainController displays the login screen, prompts user to 'Log In', 'sign up' or 'exit'
User enters 'Sign Up', controller passes to login controller which prompts user to enter name, username,
and password. login controller passes info to student manager to create new student with this information.
controller finishes signup, goes back to login prompts. user enters 'Log In', controller passes to login
controller which runs log in, prompting user for username and password. User enters previously entered username
and password, login controller finds this student exists in student manager, login controller sets logged in
to true. main controller displays the main screen. Controller prompts user to enter 'add', or 'exit'
User enters 'add', controller runs 'add event' through EventController
EventController prompts user to enter name of event, year of event, month, day, start time, end time. Passes
user input to EventManager to create event, and CalendarManager to add event to open calendar.
main controller requests CalendarPresenter present calendar again with addition of new event, goes back to
main program where user is prompted to 'add' or 'exit'
