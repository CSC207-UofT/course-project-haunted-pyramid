The MainController displays the login screen, prompts user to 'Log In', 'sign up' or 'exit'
User enters 'Sign Up', controller passes to login controller which prompts user to enter name, username,
and password. login controller passes info to student manager to create new student with this information,
requests CalendarManager create empty calendar and assign to this student.
controller finishes signup, goes back to login prompts. user enters 'Log In', controller passes to login
controller which runs log in, prompting user for username and password. User enters previously entered username
and password, login controller finds this student exists in student manager, login controller sets logged in
to true. main controller requests calendarPresenter show the empty calendar assigned to this student.
