# Accessibility Report

1. Equitable Use

- Our program provides the fixed sized screen as an initial approach. We decided on a screen size so that most users these can use. However, it would be better if we could make the size flexible, so anyone can use. This was mainly due to us being unfamiliar with Java Swing tools. As first time users, we tried our best to make the program to not discriminate any users, but the capabilities were limited. In the future, we may also support users with different language.

2. Flexibility in use
- Future: implement dark mode or high contrast mode to allow users to change the display


- Right now, users can change their settings for how they like events to be automatically scheduled - they can be a morning person or evening person, they can choose to procrastinate or not, cram, have spacing between events, etc. They can also decide when in the day they have free time (lunch, dinner, sleeping, etc.). The users can also choose to view different kinds of calendars for their schedules. Currently, monthly, weekly and daily calendars are available for the view.


- For console version, we've made it so that users can export different kinds of schedules (monthly, weekly, daily) to iCal format. Currently, GUI version can only export the entire calendar. This will be modified to enhance the flexibility.

3. Simple and Intuitive Use
- We use combo boxes for all dates and times, and large buttons with options displayed on them simply. Every process follows clear steps to complete for the user, such as adding an event.


- Event title and time are labeled on every event when selecting an event to edit.


- In the future, we will change event selection so that event buttons are added into the calendar as opposed to a String calendar that can't be interacted with so that users can directly edit events by locating them on the calendar.


- In the settings menu, there are a variety of options that can be quickly toggled such as auto-scheduling strategies - these may not be obvious to a user, and clarification / a popup may be created to help guide a user through setting their auto-scheduling preferences in the future

4. Perceptible Information

- We've made it so that the strings of calendars can be flexible to help users' legibility. However, due to the fixed sized screen and using the console version calendar directly, there are limitations for the certain aspects of the calendar (i.e. monthly calendar is only vertically flexible). By making the calendar size resizable according to user's preferences, we could enhance the perceptible information that the user can receive.


- In the future, we will implement button sizes for events that are proportional to their length

- Everything that has a time is always in chronological order


- Conflicts between events are displayed clearly below to avoid confusion to help users' understandings of their schedule.

5. Tolerance for Error

- Most of the actions are done within the given options. Checks are done for the information received (such as file name for exporting a file.)


- In creating or editing an event, there is no way for a user invalid information, as everything is controlled in combo boxes.


- It is the same in work sessions - everything is controlled in combo boxes with all legal options, and every combination is allowed.


- Simple mistakes such as a start time after an end time are corrected automatically.


- In order to prevent users from executing multiple works simultaneously, before the most works, we've frozen the previous screen that was running.


- Confirmation is required to delete an event, since it is not recoverable.

6. Low Physical Effort

- Our program only requires mouse and keyboard to be functional.

- Almost every display with resolution higher than 1400, 1000 should be able to run our program without any problem.

- We've simplified the pages as much as we can, so the users do not have to direct themselves to complicated steps.

7. Size and Space for Approach and Use

- As mentioned above, our app has a fixed size which is runnable for most users with relatively recent technologies. However, we will try to make our app resizable to accompany even more users.

- Our program has a background color and fonts that are easily recognized. Our program does not require users to be at any position, as it just runs on a computer. Thus, they can simply choose their own postures. 

- We will further develop our program into android app, allowing further size and space for approach and use for the users.


Haunted Pyramid, as an all undergraduate student group, aims to fill a void in productivity automation we have felt is lacking - automatic scheduling of time to work individually to meet goals.

We aim to market this program towards University students, but can see the potential for the program to be desirable for any individual or group who has a lot of autonomy over their work schedule. We would like to market this towards professors in University as we integrate the Event Collections function which allows a User to create a collection of events (such as lectures and deadlines, with recommended time to start working on each) and share it with other users (students in a course) who will then have the collection merged into their schedule and work sessions customized to fit their lifestyle and other commitments.

Our program is less likely to be used by people whose day to day lives do not involve intensive self-regulation or independent work with strict deadlines. For example, people who work in jobs that are fairly routine or unplannable such as someone who works in customer service will not have any need for our program. It is also unlikely to be used by children or retired people/people who are set in their workflows. Our main demographic is students because of the nature of the occupation and due to the willingness to experiment and desperation for improvement to productivity at any cost that we all feel and that drives us to try new ways of staying organized every year.
