2. Equitable Use
- text to speach 
- 
2. Flexibility in use
- Future: implement dark mode or high contrast mode to allow users to change the display
- Right now, users can change their settings for how they like events to be automatically scheduled - they can be a morning person 
or evening person, they can choose to procrastinate or not, cram, have spacing between events, etc. They can also decide when
in the day they have free time (lunch, dinner, sleeping, etc)

3. Simple and Intuitive Use
- We use combo boxes for all dates and times, and large buttons with options displayed on them simply. Every process
follows clear steps to complete for the user, such as adding an event
- Event title and time are labled on every event when selecting an event to edit
- In the future, will change event selection so that event buttons are added into the calendar as opposed to a string calendar
that can't be interacted with so that users can directly edit events by locating them on the calendar
- In the settings menu, there are a variety of options that can be quickly toggled such as procrastinate - this may not be 
obvious to a user, and clarification / a popup may be created to help guide a user through setting their autoscheduling
preferences in the future
- We will add more intuitive basic options for recursive settings on events for ease of use, 
but will keep our more flexible recursive UI for users who want to be able to more fully
customize their schedule

4. Perceptible Information
- It is currently difficult to see and read the words or figure out the lengths of events
- in the future, we will implement button sizes for events that are proportional to their length
- Everything that has a time is always in chronological order
- conflicts between events are displayed clearly below to avoid confusion

5. Tolerance for Error
- in creating or editing an event, there is no way for a user invalid information, as everything is controlled in combo boxes.
- it is the same in work sessions - everything is controlled in combo boxes with all legal options, and every combination is allowed
- simple mistakes such as a start time after an end time are corrected automatically
- confirmation is required to delete an event, since it is not recoverable

5. Low Physical Effort

6. Size and Space for Approach and Use


Haunted Pyramid, as an all undergraduate student group, aims to fill a void in productivity automation - automatic scheduling of time to work individually to meet goals. We aim to market this program towards University
students, but can see the potential for the program to be desirable to any individual or group who has a lot of autonomy
over their work schedule. We would like to market this towards professors in University as we integrate the Event Collections
function which allows a User to create a collection of events (such as lectures and deadlines, with recommended time to 
start working on each) and share it with other users (students in a course) who will then have the collection merged into
their schedule and work sessions customized to fit their lifestyle and other commitments.

Our program is less likely to be used by people whose day to day lives do not involve intensive self-regulation or independent
work with strict deadlines. For example, people who work in jobs that are fairly routine or unplannable such as someone 
who works in customer service will not have any need for our program. It is also unlikely to be used by children or retired
people/people who are set in their workflows. Our main demographic is students because of the nature of the occupation 
and due to the willingness to experiment and desperation for improvement to productivity at any cost that we all feel and that
drives us to try new ways of staying organized every year.
