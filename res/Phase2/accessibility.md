(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or

Haunted Pyramid, as an all undergraduate student group, aims to fill a void in productivity automation we have felt is
lacking - automatic scheduling of time to work individually to meet goals. We aim to market this program towards University
students, but can see the potential for the program to be desirable for any individual or group who has a lot of autonomy
over their work schedule. We would like to market this towards professors in University as we integrate the Event Collections
function which allows a User to create a collection of events (such as lectures and deadlines, with recommended time to 
start working on each) and share it with other users (students in a course) who will then have the collection merged into
their schedule and work sessions customized to fit their lifestyle and other commitments.

Our program is less likely to be used by people whose day to day lives do not involve intensive self-regulation or independent
work with strict deadlines. For example, people who work in jobs that are fairly routine or unplannable such as someone 
who works in customer service will not have any need for our program. It is also unlikely to be used by children or retired
people/people who are set in their workflows. Our main demographic is students because of the nature of the occupation 
and due to the willingness to experiment and desperation for improvement to productivity at any cost that we all feel and that
drives us to try new ways of staying organized every year.
