Our project is a Scheduling program that allows students to create different kinds of events such as tests,
assignments, repeating lectures and other more generic events and track them in a calendar. The program
will also automatically schedule work periods associated with events based on the input work time of the user.
The main entities of the program are the Student, Event, Calendar and Course, each with their own allocated
use case Manager class. The main controllers are the MainController, EventController, Login Controler, and
IOSerializable controller. The MainController instantiates all the other controllers, while the EventController
handles scheduling of events, and the login controller handles student information and login status. We are using
a text based interface for now, and plan to extend to use JavaFX in the future.
Our CRC model includes:
- Interfaces: Repeatable, Fluid, Autoschedulable
Repeatable is implemented by event types such as lecture, to allow scheduling of lists of events of the same
name. Fluid is implemented by event types such as assignment, to assign non-scheduled hours that can be
autoscheduled by the program (work sessions), and autoshcedulable makes specific events (work sessions) 
eligible for autoscheduling and reconfiguring without fixed start and end times.
- Entities: Event [children: Lecture, Reading, Lab, Test, Assignment, Tutorial, Other], Course, Student,
OurCalendar. These are listed by Parent class at the top, followed by its children.
- Use Cases: CalendarManager, EventManager, StudentManager, CourseManager
each is responsible for getting information about each, storing and creating instances of these objects, 
and organizing them
- Controllers: MainController, LoginController, EventController, StudentController
Maincontroller instantiates all other controllers, LoginController tracks login status as program runs 
and controls login process. EventController works with EventManager and CalendarManager to add and schedule
events.
- Gateways:
IOSerializable serializes/deserializes files storing student info, course info, event and calendar info.
We implemented the maincontroller with the intention of delegating some of its tasks to an EventController in
the future, as well as several other controllers such as StudentController, CourseController, and
CalendarController as the functionaliy of our program expands to include more complex interaction with these
entities, in order to better satisfy the single responsibility principle. Our scenario uses a main controller,
a login controller, an Event controllre, the basic Event entity, the OurCalendar Entity, the Student Entity, and each of the student,
event, and calendar managers. it also uses the calendarPresenter.
It follows the user signing up through the login controller and text IO, having an empty calendar displayed by
the controller using the calendarPresenter. They are prompted to add an event by the controller, which takes
input and passes it to the EventManager to add a new event, then passes the event to the Calendar Manager
which adds the event. The controller then Accesses calendar Presenter again to re-display the calendar with
the event added. Our skeleton program allows a user to log in, access a new (not stored) calendar, input
basic events with start and end times, and be notified of conflicts. We have implemented the basic controller
to run the scenario, and have created all the major entities and defined the basic Interfaces for special
Events. There is one main class for running the program, and one presenter for formatting calendars, which is
used in the scenario.
Seo and Shameel have been working on the CalendarManager, Calendar, and CalendarPresenter classes. They have
created a system for creating empty calendars, adding events to calendars, and displaying monthly calendars
as is used in the scenario, as well as furthering the functionality with weekly and daily calendars. They will
be continuing to develop the calendar related classes to do more complex scheduling, such as for repeating and
automatically scheduled events, as well as eliminating the dependency of CalendarManager on the actual Event
class. Sebin has been working on the controllers and serializable IO for reading and writing student info to
files, and will continue to work on the gateways and file writing for saving student data and events.
Malik has been working on implementing the course and student entities which will be used more when we
begin saving information and accumulating a database of course information and possibly extend to automate some
aspects of scheduling based on course enrollment at UofT. He will continue to work on these entities as well as
the student and course controllers and managers to better localize interactions with these classes as the
program becomes more complex. Teddy has been working on keeping CRC cards up to date and developing
documentation for the code. Taite has been working on the Event class, controller, and manager and has created
a system for creating and adding basic events, storing them, and interacting with them. She plans
to modify Events to use ID's instead of names to avoid repetition issues in the future, as well as designing
and implementing several Child classes of Event such as Assignments and Lectures that can be scheduled in more
specific ways such as repeatedly and automatically, and created more easily with more default values and less
user input. Since our entities all require their own fairly seperated hierarchies of classes to interact with
them, we have been able to effectively delegate responsibilities with hardly any conflict, and have been able
to modify without raising errors in other parts of the program. We have focused on maintaining the hierarchy of
classes and adhering to the single responsibility principle, and it has made the implementation of the basic
skeleton of our code a fairly smooth process. Our primary issue is our ineffective use of github, but that is
a workable problem. our other concern is for our graphic user interface, and whether we should use JavaFX or
commit to learning enough HTML/CSS and Javadoc as a group to implement that in the time given. What would be a
realistic GUI to aim for?
